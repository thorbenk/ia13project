class Processing:
    """

    The basic idea here is:
        - Create channels from Input Image like Laplacian, Gradient
        Magnitude, ..., loaded from harddisk.
        They are all voxel-wise. This is done by ChannelGenerators.

        - Scale input data beforhand: there are several possible ways of scaling
        an image. This however only works, if the dimension of the image will
        not be changed. The scaling will be done by Scalers. This has the
        advantage, that channel generator, that don't have an own scaling
        mechanism, can share precomputed scales of the raw data. This safes
        computation time. 

        However, the scaling can also be handy for convolution filters, as you
        can minimize the filter kernel and so the computation time will be
        smaller as well.

        - Calculate some statistics of the channels. Do this Supervoxel-wise.
        This is done by ChannelFeatures.

        - Finally calculate Supervoxel-Features like Size, volume of convex
        hull, PCA, ... This will be done by SupervoxelFeatures. They might also
        use Scalers beforhand. 



    This class is responsible for the whole feature processing step.

    It schedules the processing for each channel generator.
    If the channel generator is an instrinsic channel generator, than it also
    receives scaled input, if desired.

    Afterwards it linearizes the memory for each supervoxel, so that channel
    features might work faster.

    It then calls the channel features (statistic on channels) and concatenates all
    channel features for each supervoxel into one vector.

    Lastly, the supervoxel features will be calculated.

    All features for each supervoxel then will be merged.
